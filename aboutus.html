        This is a legitimate question, because there are many good choices out there. We are happy to be part of an industry with such healthy competition, and we are confident that even with the tough competition we are a clear leader in our field.

        •	We have an unwavering commitment to a high quality product line. This has become even more important in recent years, as more and more low quality items are hitting the market. The industry is being flooded with hyped products that do not perform as they should, and fierce competition is making it more important to be early to market than to put in proper development time. Through this chaotic process, the end user needs a skilled advocate to help identify true quality. PC_Service Systems is committed to be this advocate, as one of our core values. We have the experience to know when to be suspicious, and we have the resources to test products for ourselves. If a product stands up to our expectations, we still continue to evaluate it over time. We have the volume to be able to use statistical data to identify reliability trends over time, but we're also small enough to be very responsive to what we find. If a product does not cut it, we don't sell it. We want to make sure that you as a buyer are comfortable choosing from any of our options, knowing that if we sell it, we stand behind it. It is worth noting that this is not always easy. There are some very motivated manufacturers that do not share these values, that can mount considerable pressure. The answers aren't always black and white, and things like marketing funds, kick-backs, deep discounts, and shared advertising can make decisions very complicated. We know this is why some of our competitors are selling parts we would not.

        •	We are constantly self improving. Just as important to product line selection, is what we do with those products. We have carefully crafted each of our processes to generate self-feedback. Every support ticket opened, every RMA item, and every repaired computer is brought to the attention of all departments further up the line. We hold weekly feedback meetings, where every issue that needs it is discussed. It is very important to us that we not only set up firm feedback cycles, but that we establish clear lines of accountability. In our eyes, this is the best path to constant improvement. It has been amazing to see this in action. As time goes on, we solve problem after problem, making sure they do not have the possibility to happen again. And as each problem is solved, we can turn our attention to smaller problems. The cycle is never ending.

        •	We are available to you. We are proud of our transparency. Some of our competitors use tactics of providing as little detail about themselves as possible, to appear larger or more credible than they are. At PC_Service Systems, we are confident in ourselves and our abilities, and view it as a strength to share as much information about ourselves as we can. You can view our staff biographies by clicking on pictures on left hand side of this page, read our blog, or just give us a call or stop by! It has never made sense to us to hold anything back -- because PEOPLE are where the strength of any company comes from. This spirit of transparency carries over to all aspects of our business. This information helps you make more informed decisions, and it only strengthens us as well. We're excited to form a community with our customers.
